# SmartLagSwitch
"Smart" IAT Based Lag Switch

Stage car and once your firmly on the brakes, the RED LED will be on.

Push your momentary switch to CUT the IAT sensor off. The GREEN LED will be on.

This is when your IAT table in the PCM is turned to reduce all timing that you can.

Now you can build up boost with no timing.

Now with BOTH hands on the wheel and ready to go, let go of the break.

The IAT is now renabled and off you go!

( Optional )

Potentiometer knob added.

Adjust from 0 to 1 second of delay from turning the IAT back on.

100ms increments.

All the way down ( 0/zero) is OFF. NO DELAY.

Turn up to 1 - 10 reading and will be 100ms, 200ms, 300ms... 1000ms ( 1 second )

Can use this to help let car roll out a few feet before giving it the thunder!
